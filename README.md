#Long Now Chalk: Mandalla Time

an experiment with Juerg Lehni's awesome Paper.js library because I met him yesterday at the Long Now Foundation working on his chalkboard robot (which takes JSON input from paper).

Mandalla Time takes the current date and feeds that as the random seed into chance.js, then uses the pseudorandom output to set the radii of the circles, each representing a single minute in the day.
